# record_on_button.py
# Teensy 4.1 + Adafruit SPH0645 (I2S mic)
# Press D2 (to GND) -> record N seconds to /sdcard/rec_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav, then exit.

"""
Single-press one-shot audio recorder for Teensy 4.1 using an SPH0645 I2S microphone.

Behavior
--------
1) On import/run, the script announces the SD mount contents and waits for a single
   active-LOW button press on D2.
2) When pressed, it records `SECONDS` of audio from the I2S microphone at 44.1 kHz,
   converts the SPH0645's 24-bit samples (carried in the upper 24 bits of a 32-bit
   frame) down to 16-bit PCM, and writes a timestamped WAV to /sdcard/.
3) The LED on D13 blinks during capture and turns off when done.
4) The script then exits with SystemExit(0) so tools like `mpremote run` return.

Notes
-----
- File writing is atomic: data is captured into a temporary file (*.tmp) and then
  renamed into place after the WAV sizes are patched.
- The WAV header is written up front with placeholder sizes and patched on completion.
- MCK is provided in the I2S constructor but the SPH0645 ignores it; leaving it in
  matches many working pinouts. A commented alternative shows how to omit it entirely.
- Do not modify constants or logic unless you intend to change functionality.

Hardware
--------
- BUTTON_PIN (D2): Active-LOW; press to start a single recording.
- LED_PIN    (D13): Status LED; blinks while recording.
- I2S pins: BCLK=D21, WS/LRCLK=D20, SD/DATA=D8, MCK=D23 (optional for mic).

Tested Environment
------------------
- MicroPython/Teensy 4.1 style I2S API (using `machine.I2S`).
