# 🐾 Shaman I — Poacher Detection Sensor System

## 📘 Purpose
Define the engineering requirements for a sensor system designed to **detect and locate poachers** in the **rainforests of Costa Rica**, incorporating:
- Hardware  
- Firmware  
- Software  
- Embedded AI  
- Mesh network communication  

---

## 🌎 System Overview
The system is a **self-contained, ruggedized sensor node** designed for **autonomous deployment in tropical rainforest environments**.  
It detects **acoustic and visual cues** associated with poaching activity and transmits data through a **mesh network**.

## 🧭 Plan of Action

### 1. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) — Rapid Iteration
- Develop the first **universal translator prototype** to assist software integration teams with system validation.  
- Evaluate **power draw, heat generation, and nodal processing viability** over the mesh network.  
- These findings will guide software teams in setting realistic performance and energy expectations.

### 2. Testing Procedures & Early Development
- During component order lead time (≈2–3 weeks), design and document **rapid testing procedures**.  
- Once the PoC is functional:
  - Prioritize and manage testing queue.
  - Prototype development to occur at **KwF lab**, subject to available personnel.  
  - Consider a **remotely operable testing apparatus** to enable continuous software testing.

### 3. Shaman I — Second-Stage Prototype
- Focus shifts to **designing and assembling Shaman I**, a more cohesive system with integrated housing and circuit board.  
- Field testing begins **after the Fall intern period (Dec 12)**.  
- The **fully assembled Shaman I** serves as the **Fall (3-month) deliverable**.

### 4. Future Work — Spring Internship
- Data and insights from **Shaman I** will:
  - Form the foundation for **Spring development**.
  - Be integrated into **health monitoring systems** for the foundation’s **two snow leopards**.
  - Support **future AI and bioacoustics software** efforts.
